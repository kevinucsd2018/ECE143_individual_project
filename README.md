# ECE143_individual_project

  This project writes clearly documented, clean, and modular code to answer the following questions, with data visualizations
  included to aid the understanding. More in-depth documentation and explnantion are in the source file
  
  (1) Given an overall desired coverage footprint and a sequence of  n communications towers, what is the resulting resolved       coverage?
  
  (2) What is the total area of coverage relative to the desired total coverage area of the original footprint? That is, are       there any gaps in coverage?

  (3) On average, how many communications towers are required before full coverage is obtained?
